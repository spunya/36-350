Hello! You have reached Earth - a planet home to thousands of organisms. My name is Shreya, and I am a human living on Earth. I am 20 earth years old (20 times around the sun), which is quite young for a human. If you have not already seen, humans can be quite diverse organisms. We are social, unpredictable, and constantly advancing. If you are reading this message, that most likely means everything else in the world got destroyed or that you are really fast at processing information. Either way, welcome to our planet. We mean no harm as long as you are transparent about your motives. As a species, we are quite disorganized, so we would prefer not to come together and fight unless absolutely necessary. Hope to meet you in person!
